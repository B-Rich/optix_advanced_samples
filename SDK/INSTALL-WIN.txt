Requirements for 64-bit Windows:

* CUDA Toolkit version 7.5+ and matching driver with supported GPU.
* OptiX version 4.0+.
* Visual Studio 2013 or 2015
* CMake (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html).


Instructions for building:

1. Start up cmake-gui from the Start Menu.

2. Select the SDK directory from optix_advanced_samples as the source file location.

3. Create a build directory that isn't the same as the source directory. 
   For example, SDK\build. If you type in the directory instead of using the 
   "Browse Build..." button, CMake will prompt to create the directory if
   it doesn't already exist.

4. Press "Configure" button and select the version of Visual Studio you wish to
   use.  Note that the 64-bit compiles are separate from the 32-bit compiles
   (e.g. look for "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64").  Leave all other options on
   their default.  Press "OK".

5. Press "Configure" again.  Followed by "Generate".

6. Open the OptiX-Advanced-Samples.sln solution file in the build directory you created.

7. Select "Build Solution" from the IDE.

8. Right click on one of the sample program targets in the solution explorer and
   select "Set as start up project".

9. Run the sample.  "q" or "Esc" will close the window.

Note that due to the way dependencies are automatically handled for CUDA
compilation in Visual Studio, if you build again Visual Studio will likely ask
you to reload your projects.  Please do so.  Subsequent compiles should not
result in reloading unless you change the files that are included by a CUDA
file.
