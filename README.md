optix_advanced_samples
==================

This is a set of advanced samples for the [NVIDIA OptiX Ray Tracing Engine](https://developer.nvidia.com/optix).
They assume some previous experience with OptiX, unlike the basic
tutorial-style samples in the SDK directory of the OptiX 4.0 distribution.
They also use some different libraries than the SDK samples; GLFW and imgui in
place of GLUT, for example.  This means you cannot generally copy one of the
advanced samples directly into the SDK, and vice versa.

Some samples, like optixVox, are new.  Others used to ship in some form with
OptiX prior to version 4.
